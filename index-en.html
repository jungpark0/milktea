            Winter 2021 — first time into milk tea.<br>
            Tried many cafes since.<br>
            Prefer sweet, milky ones.<br>
            Started keeping record in Jan 2025.<br>  
            <span style="text-decoration: underline;">10</span> cups, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">10</span> cafes so far.

            Wasn’t planning to start with milk tea.
			It just came up while thinking about what to put on the website.
			I happened to be drinking milk tea a lot at the time.
			Still keeping notes — places, flavors, stories, atmosphere.

            The best kind of milk tea, for me, is royal milk tea.
			It’s a bit sweet, and overall just really smooth.
			The strong milk flavor tones down the typical tea scent.
			I never really liked the smell of black tea or Earl Grey in milk tea.
			But lately, I don’t mind it.
			The more I drink it, the more I get used to it.
			Feels like my taste is slowly changing.

            I have my own standard for what is a good milk tea.
			It’s the royal milk tea from a place called Gabie.
			Gabie is a café near Hongdae.
			I used to spend a lot of time around there, so I’d go to the café pretty often.
			People usually order coffee at cafés,
			but I don’t like coffee, so I went with milk tea instead.
			That’s how I ended up trying Gabie’s royal milk tea.
			I ordered it without much thought, but it turned out to be really good.
			That was the first time I felt like milk tea could actually taste great.
